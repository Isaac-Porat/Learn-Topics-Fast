0.0 | let me know if this sounds familiar you
1.92 | want to be a successful entrepreneur you
3.48 | want to make lots and lots of money who
5.58 | doesn't so you start a business or you
9.0 | start investing or maybe even you pick
12.12 | up a second job and for some reason
13.98 | you're still not a millionaire but maybe
17.0 | maybe there is a reason why and that
20.64 | reason is because you have not yet
22.56 | mastered your mindset right now you're
25.26 | focused on the physical world of getting
27.539 | your money right and you might have
28.98 | completely neglected the metaphysical
30.84 | world of attracting success so that
32.759 | money comes to you
34.32 | guys the topic of manifesting money gets
36.54 | me so excited because it does not
38.7 | discriminate you can be any person
40.02 | anywhere in the world and take advantage
41.579 | of mastering your mindset and there is
43.86 | no better person to talk about this than
45.719 | Luke Belmar joining me here today is
48.12 | Luke Belmar he is an eight-figure
50.52 | e-commerce entrepreneur private Equity
53.399 | investor and co-founder of Capital Club
55.62 | welcome Luke thanks for having me
59.059 | thank you
63.18 | so we got some questions that dive
65.64 | really deep here today Luke are you
68.04 | ready I'm ready let's shoot let's do it
71.04 | so we just went over all the many ways
73.2 | in which you've made millions of dollars
75.36 | and whether it was crypto or e-commerce
78.54 | the one constant about your success is
82.56 | that you've been tuned into a very
84.299 | specific mindset so how would you
87.36 | describe to someone about what goes on
89.159 | inside your head to be able to manifest
91.68 | success there's such thing as a
94.14 | millionaire mindset so out of the entire
97.74 | variables in which I've made money
99.299 | there's been three constants in my
101.759 | mindset that have always allowed me to
104.82 | elevate not beyond my competition but
107.28 | Beyond Myself you know my first
108.9 | principle is don't compete create and
112.14 | it's this idea that there is no
114.36 | competition there is no competitive
116.159 | business it's just me myself creating
119.399 | the best products the best Services the
121.56 | best experiences that I can for either
123.06 | myself or my customers and relying
125.579 | solely on that because we understand
127.5 | that you know many times when we compare
129.78 | ourselves comparison is the killer of
132.0 | Joy right so if you're consistently
133.5 | comparing yourself to other people
135.06 | you're gonna find yourself expending
137.459 | energy unnecessary energy instead of
139.62 | creating you're going to be competing or
142.08 | comparing yourself that's the first one
143.76 | the second one is positivity you need to
146.819 | be consistently positive in a world that
149.94 | is negative right so if you're in a
152.16 | world that is completely negative that
154.2 | they're always shining you saying hey
155.819 | you know what entrepreneurship isn't
157.2 | going to work or you know this is scammy
159.72 | or you shouldn't attempt e-commerce
162.239 | because it's oversaturated you know you
165.48 | have to consistently repeat yourself and
167.459 | be your number one cheerleader because
168.78 | if you don't support yourself I mean how
170.519 | can you expect others to support you and
172.8 | every genius was first considered a
174.84 | madman and that's kind of the equations
176.519 | whether it was Leonardo Da Vinci whether
178.56 | it was Sir Isaac Newton whether it was
180.48 | Einstein or whether it was Jeff Bezos
183.84 | right when the internet was coming out
186.3 | all of these Mad Men were then revered
189.599 | as Geniuses and the reason they were
191.22 | revered as Geniuses was because leading
193.68 | to my third point in the mindset they
195.72 | were ahead of their time this means that
198.12 | you need to develop a futurist mindset a
200.7 | person that doesn't live in the present
202.26 | moment but a person that lives in the
204.0 | future so that when the future catches
205.8 | up that person is already prepared
207.599 | because we live in a world that is
209.76 | changing so quickly I mean I remember
211.739 | getting started with Shopify back in
213.54 | 2016 and it was a completely different
216.42 | platform it was a completely different
217.98 | game than it is today right we didn't
219.9 | have all these crazy plug-ins we didn't
221.819 | have all these tools that could Elevate
224.819 | us in a very automated fashion it was a
227.819 | lot of like hustle and grind work I
229.319 | still remember getting on on support
230.94 | calls with with uh the code team and
233.58 | helping them tweak my landing page and
236.04 | things of this nature whereby nowadays
238.5 | you have like 900 different apps that
240.54 | help you create a landing page and
241.86 | things of this sort so being a futurist
244.08 | and being able to be okay with the
246.84 | discomfort of being misunderstood I
249.299 | think is one of the keys of
250.319 | Entrepreneurship whether it was crypto
251.7 | and I started buying Bitcoin for a
253.319 | couple hundred bucks in 2016 and people
255.78 | were laughing at me they're like why are
257.579 | you buying this garbage it makes no
259.079 | sense I'm like you know what there may
261.299 | be something to it and the entire
263.58 | premise comes from the initial mindset
266.52 | which is to have a student's mind to
269.22 | learn from the greats that have come
270.66 | before you because patterns repeat
273.0 | themselves you can see these patterns
275.16 | play out in in the world in a natural
277.5 | fashion you have the Four Seasons right
279.96 | you have fall winter summer spring you
282.9 | have Cosmic Cycles you have the planets
285.54 | revolving around the Sun but the same
288.0 | patterns exist in business the same
289.74 | patterns exist in finance and if you can
291.6 | identify those patterns be okay with the
293.58 | discomfort of being a bad man and
295.919 | develop a student's mind to be able to
298.32 | perceive the future and not always
299.82 | accurate but to live in the future
301.62 | instead of the present moment in a
303.78 | constantly evolving world I think you
306.06 | have a millionaire mindset that's really
308.759 | interesting what are those patterns that
310.68 | you look out for so the patterns that I
312.72 | look out for are human Tendencies right
315.36 | so behavioral Tendencies are what
317.94 | dictate the world I look at two two
320.1 | patterns the first one is do the
322.38 | opposite of what the mainstream is doing
324.36 | so whatever the mass is doing do the
326.52 | opposite that's the first thing why
328.68 | because most people tend to be followers
330.66 | and the last thing you want to be is the
332.699 | follower of a follower that's the worst
334.8 | place you can be at right just following
336.66 | the crowd the second tendency that I
338.46 | look at is you need to be able to do
341.1 | things that are new so what that means
345.18 | is that the learning curve may be a
347.28 | little bit harder and people tend to
350.28 | shun what is new so I look at two things
352.1 | contrarian I'm a big contrarian so I do
354.479 | a lot of the opposite things that you
356.22 | know the average person does whether
358.139 | it's in eating habits whether it's in
359.88 | crypto whether it's in business you name
362.16 | it so big contrarian that's the first
364.32 | pattern recognition that I look at is
366.539 | what are people doing let me do the
368.28 | opposite and then the second pattern
370.259 | recognition that I really like to look
372.24 | at which is a I can't coin it because it
375.9 | was created I think it was by the
377.58 | founder of Adele it's called Uh Moore's
380.699 | Law and Moore's Law dictates that you
383.759 | know
384.539 | as technology advances it doubles in
387.96 | speed but it also doubles in efficiency
390.66 | costs so it becomes cheaper but it
392.4 | becomes quicker I think it's every two
394.56 | years so by Moore's Law you see a big
398.4 | gradual curve towards technological
400.5 | advancement and as You Follow that you
403.259 | no longer want to be doing things in the
404.759 | past but things of the future because
406.08 | the future is moving so quickly like if
407.699 | I told you five years ago that you're
410.46 | going to be able to log into a website
411.96 | ask this website absolutely anything and
415.259 | it could spit out an essay chat GPT
417.0 | right if it could spit out a complete
418.86 | essay it could spit out a complete novel
421.86 | in seconds it'd be a little bit hard to
424.8 | believe right so where are we going to
426.78 | be in five years with technological
428.88 | advancements like artificial
429.96 | intelligence and how can we position
431.759 | ourselves ahead of time in order to
434.22 | succeed so I look at Moore's law for the
437.759 | speed of technological advancements and
440.099 | I'm a contrarian so whatever the crowd
442.199 | is doing I like to do the complete
444.24 | opposite it sounds like you are a risk
446.58 | taker which is you know we'll hop into
448.68 | that later and I'm excited to talk about
450.18 | that but uh I was watching a recent
452.52 | interview where you said the money's
454.56 | Gonna Come instead of chasing the money
457.08 | become someone that knows how to make
459.24 | money and the money will be made and
461.58 | that that is the basic Law of Attraction
463.259 | but just like yourself a lot of people
465.9 | watching this Channel right now might
468.12 | not come from money they might not even
469.38 | have access to the necessary tools like
471.78 | a laptop for example so
474.479 | how would you explain to our viewers
476.58 | then that no matter what stage of the
478.68 | game they're in how can they become
480.66 | someone who knows how to make money so
482.88 | you need to start understanding what is
484.74 | money where does it come from who who
487.68 | allows money to exist what is the thesis
491.34 | behind you know the dollar for example
493.259 | the Fiat ecosystem and when you begin to
495.9 | evaluate it you begin to realize that
498.599 | money is just a byproduct of the value
500.879 | that you provide to the marketplace so
503.28 | if you don't have access to a laptop you
504.96 | don't need access to a laptop in order
506.819 | to provide value to the marketplace you
508.56 | could in your local town or in your
510.84 | neighborhood you could provide value by
512.7 | perceiving value so what you need to
514.8 | develop is skill sets that allow money
518.399 | to flow because money by definition
522.14 | is a means of exchange so what are you
525.06 | exchanging value for Value in this case
528.36 | we perceive the dollar to have value
530.16 | whether it's an imaginary value that we
532.5 | perceive or not as irrelevant but the
535.32 | other person may want another piece of
537.06 | value for exchange it may be your time
539.22 | it may be your work it may be a service
541.74 | it may be
543.36 | counsel right people that that go to
545.459 | counseling because some people pay for
547.08 | those things right so
549.06 | value also happens to be relative right
552.959 | because what may be valuable to you what
554.7 | you what you may be willing to pay for
556.38 | may not be valuable to me and what I'm
558.66 | willing to pay for so what you need to
559.98 | identify is a need in the market an
562.98 | avatar an ideal character in that market
565.44 | that fits that profile of value that
568.2 | you're trying to provide and then be the
570.6 | person or the company that goes in and
573.18 | provides that service and provides that
575.519 | value in exchange for money and the
578.16 | premise in order to make a lot of money
579.72 | is very simple I divide into three
582.3 | categories two or three categories the
584.279 | first one is you need to be the best at
586.2 | what you do not the cheapest at what you
588.48 | do you need to be the best at what you
590.279 | do because if you charge if you get
591.899 | clients based off of being cheap as
594.3 | opposed to being the best then you're
596.279 | not going to get the best clientele the
598.2 | first thing is you need to be the best
599.339 | at what you do so you can't just go
600.899 | straight into the marketplace assuming
603.18 | that with with undeveloped skills you're
606.42 | going to make money Abraham Lincoln said
608.1 | if I had six hours to shop down a tree I
609.839 | would spend the first floor sharpening
611.1 | my ax this means that he spent time
613.62 | sharpening his tools so as an
615.06 | entrepreneur you have a plethora of
616.74 | tools that you utilize in your toolbox
619.08 | the question is how much time do you
620.82 | spend
621.899 | sharpening them how much time do you
623.7 | spend reading how much time do you spend
625.019 | networking how much time do you spend if
627.06 | you're doing Shopify on on the platform
629.22 | playing with the platform developing and
631.62 | understanding and know-how of the
633.06 | platform if most of you guys are paying
635.16 | processing payments what's your
636.42 | relationship with your payment processor
637.92 | what's your understanding of marketing
639.6 | and Facebook ads what's your
640.8 | understanding of of the service that
642.899 | you're trying to provide and when people
644.459 | ask you questions how good are you at
645.899 | responding these questions how good are
647.399 | you at customer service or fulfillment
649.079 | all these things are skill sets that are
651.48 | going to allow you to monetize your
654.0 | business extremely well so the first
655.38 | point is you need to be the best at what
657.72 | you do the second thing is you need to
659.579 | be Irreplaceable if you want to succeed
661.86 | in your business
663.18 | your tool your product your service
665.579 | needs to be Irreplaceable if you look at
667.8 | for example a jockey the guy that rides
670.5 | you know those horses those million
672.0 | dollar racehorses
673.5 | I mean think about these guys are making
676.079 | tens of millions of dollars a year if
678.24 | not millions of dollars a year and all
680.339 | they do is ride a horse or the good
681.959 | thing is is the profile of this
683.579 | individual with the skill set of this
685.079 | individual the height of this individual
686.579 | the weight of this individual is so
688.14 | particular that they are irreplaceable
690.48 | therefore you get paid in proportion to
692.94 | your irreplaceability so if you're
694.92 | highly Irreplaceable Elon Musk for
697.14 | example putting people on Mars you're
698.88 | going to get paid in proportion to the
700.38 | difficulty of being able to replace that
702.42 | individual which is extremely difficult
704.04 | so you need to be the best at what you
705.839 | do you need to be Irreplaceable and
708.36 | finally you need to do something that is
710.519 | relevant right product Market fit is key
713.7 | you cannot be out here selling
716.339 | I don't know land networks when 5G and
721.2 | Google Fiber Optic is available you
724.079 | can't be selling door-to-door books when
727.26 | people have access to the internet it
729.24 | may be a good product but a good product
730.86 | with no Market fit and with no demands
733.44 | right is irrelevant so in order for you
736.14 | to make money you need to be the best at
738.0 | what you do which requires the
739.14 | development of skills you need to become
740.82 | Irreplaceable so your skill sets need to
742.62 | be refined in such a way and you need to
744.18 | position yourself in such a way that
745.5 | it's hard to find a different a person
747.12 | that matches a profile like you and what
749.64 | you do needs to be in high demand so
752.399 | once you add this equation regardless of
755.16 | who you are whether you're getting
756.959 | started you want to scale or you're
759.18 | already successful this equation with
762.48 | enough dedication with enough train of
764.519 | thought will give you the blueprint in
766.62 | order to begin to monetize yourself your
769.26 | business your product or get to the next
770.94 | level the saying you are who you
773.639 | surround yourself with is so true and I
775.56 | know you're a big advocate kit of being
777.24 | surrounded by the kind of people who
779.339 | encourage you to grow so what are those
781.56 | green flags that you look for and what
783.42 | are those red flags like if you see
784.8 | someone doing X when do you choose to
787.32 | say this is not for me and choose to
789.6 | protect your energy instead that's a
791.94 | great question I often tell my people
794.16 | inside Capital Club if you want to fly
795.779 | with the Eagles you can't spend your
797.279 | time with those that pluck your feathers
799.139 | all right so if you want to elevate
800.76 | yourself and you want to be at the top
802.92 | you can't surround yourself with people
804.899 | you mentioned the word energy right when
807.0 | you begin to study what energy is and
809.7 | you take it back to quantum mechanics
811.86 | and quantum physics you begin to
813.54 | understand the entire world is comprised
815.639 | of energy everything is the law of
817.92 | vibration right everything vibrates
819.48 | nothing stands still so everything is
821.399 | vibrating at a different frequency so if
823.8 | you're surrounding yourself with a lot
825.0 | of people that are low at a lower
826.44 | vibrational frequency why because
827.88 | they're negative they're always
829.019 | pessimistic they have bad habits or
831.3 | addictions there is a high likelihood
833.82 | that not at a moral level you may be
836.6 | subjugated to that vibration but at a
839.519 | energetic level and at a proximity level
842.22 | you may begin to contract whether it's
844.62 | directly or indirectly that low
846.42 | vibrational frequency so you need to
848.22 | surround yourself with people that are
849.839 | operating in high vibration
852.24 | love gratitude authenticity these are
856.2 | the things that I look for when it comes
858.06 | to the people that I want to surround
859.38 | myself with when it comes to business
860.76 | when it comes to personal relationships
863.16 | there is no difference if you get a
865.26 | business partner or you get a spouse
867.899 | you're still married to this person in
870.18 | fact that could even debate we could
871.38 | even debate that you spend more time
873.3 | with your colleagues in your in your
875.22 | co-workers than you do at home and that
877.019 | you do with your with your family right
878.579 | so in some way shape or form these
880.56 | people are your family so you need to
881.88 | protect your energy by understanding the
884.519 | importance of what energy means
887.339 | it's very interesting because going back
890.22 | to your question the few things that I
891.48 | look at the first one is authenticity
893.04 | that's that's the that's the beacon by
895.62 | which I conduct everything that I do
897.06 | right so I want to be an authentic
898.38 | individual wearing a mask is tiresome
901.74 | wearing a mask is completely
905.279 | overrated why because
908.22 | that mask was comprised by the ideas the
911.88 | dreams and the Ambitions and the
913.68 | propaganda of other people so it's not
916.62 | that you're being fake is that you're
918.12 | being
918.899 | somebody else and that's the worst thing
921.48 | that you can be is somebody else whether
923.399 | it's good or bad what you want to be is
924.779 | the most authentic version of yourself
926.1 | which goes back to the first question
927.779 | being Irreplaceable right becoming the
930.839 | best version of yourself will eventually
932.82 | lead you to become Irreplaceable because
934.32 | most people are just
936.6 | carcasses of the Ambitions and dreams of
938.699 | other men or other women they aren't
940.92 | themselves so I like to hang out with I
943.56 | like to spend time with people that are
946.38 | authentic that's the first one the
948.06 | second thing that I look for is loyalty
950.1 | in business especially with my C Level
952.38 | especially with people that are higher
954.959 | ups in my organization
956.639 | I look for missionaries not mercenaries
960.079 | mercenaries are people that are for hire
961.98 | right they they just come in for the
963.959 | paycheck and then they leave but
965.579 | missionaries those are the ones that
967.38 | carry the vision those are the ones that
969.36 | carry the mission those are the ones
971.279 | that are with you long term so those
974.04 | people you need to nurture them not as
976.5 | employees but as people that maintain
979.199 | and sustain the culture of your
981.66 | organization I look for authenticity I
984.0 | look for loyalty and the final thing
986.279 | that I look for is integrity what this
988.68 | person does and who they say they are
991.32 | and the things that they do in secret
993.06 | the small things
994.8 | are they honest people because yeah we
998.1 | can talk about logistics we can talk
1000.079 | about skill sets but I can teach all
1001.639 | those things I can teach somebody how to
1003.62 | run Facebook ads you know I can teach
1005.18 | somebody how to build a Shopify store
1007.759 | that converts extremely well that has
1010.1 | low CPAs or has you know really high add
1013.04 | to cards but I can't teach somebody
1014.6 | Integrity I can't teach somebody honesty
1016.88 | I can't teach somebody to be a
1018.8 | missionary inside my organization but to
1021.019 | the point of being a missionary
1022.699 | you need to be a person that instills
1026.36 | a vision and that means that you as a
1029.0 | CEO as a founder or as a business
1031.16 | partner you need to come in with
1034.459 | the desire and the intention of not just
1037.699 | saying hey today we're going to go make
1038.9 | money because that's fleeting but you
1041.179 | need to develop what I like to call the
1043.4 | Social bank account many people just
1046.4 | want to whether it's their employees or
1047.959 | their team members they just want to
1049.28 | fill up the monetary bank account but
1052.16 | they don't like to fill up the emotional
1054.02 | bank account the social bank account the
1056.179 | part of business that nobody really
1058.28 | Converses about which is how you retain
1060.5 | employees which is how you sustain
1062.66 | relationships is by nurturing and always
1066.2 | depositing money
1068.0 | money being value into that
1071.66 | emotional bank account so the question
1073.64 | to people listening is with the people
1076.4 | that you surround yourself with right if
1078.08 | you're looking for loyalty if you're
1079.16 | looking for missionaries if you're
1080.66 | looking for people that are of Integrity
1082.58 | how much are you depositing into these
1085.4 | people because it's easy to be like oh
1087.38 | well I want all the all this stuff from
1088.88 | these people right it's is I want to
1090.86 | find people that are have a lot of
1092.419 | integrity and people that are
1093.559 | missionaries but how much are you
1094.94 | investing into those people in order to
1097.52 | see that fruit you've often heard it
1100.1 | said you know you reap what you sow so
1102.02 | the question is what are you sewing
1103.58 | every single day in your relationships
1104.96 | with the people around you because you
1106.7 | will reap in direct proportion to that
1108.26 | which you sow so those are my uh
1110.419 | principles on what I look for uh with
1113.36 | the people that I try to associate
1114.799 | myself with and yes you are a cumulative
1119.9 | of the people that you surround yourself
1121.7 | with I wholeheartedly believe that those
1124.039 | are some green flags what are your red
1125.6 | flags
1126.98 | I would say the antithesis of it you
1129.26 | know the antithesis of it inauthentic
1131.179 | people
1132.039 | that uh aren't have no integrity and
1134.9 | people that are mercenaries it's not
1137.059 | necessarily a bad thing but when it
1138.74 | comes to my core people you know the
1140.48 | people that run with me every single day
1142.4 | you have your group of people like your
1143.78 | your day ones the people that you love
1145.7 | that you know that whether you lose
1147.799 | everything today whether you have to go
1149.84 | back to Canada whatever happens you know
1152.179 | at the end of the day it can be like a
1153.38 | crazy world
1155.059 | they still got you back right those are
1156.919 | your missionaries those are the people
1158.24 | that ride with you so the antithesis of
1161.0 | the green flags would be my my red flags
1163.46 | okay more on that I know that you
1165.74 | believe
1166.64 | that no matter how much you know about a
1169.039 | topic it will never be as valuable as
1171.5 | the people you know in that business
1173.539 | whether it's the stock market or
1176.419 | e-commerce business is always an
1178.82 | Insider's game so for our viewers that
1181.28 | don't just want to be on the bleachers
1182.66 | watching the game they want to be in the
1185.0 | arena playing the game what is the key
1187.34 | to gaining access for a shot at playing
1189.32 | well first you want to have to play
1191.6 | and you need to understand the
1193.1 | implications of playing playing isn't
1195.14 | just saying hey coach put me in right
1197.299 | the coach has to trust you you have to
1198.74 | develop the skill sets in order to be
1200.78 | valuable in order to get into the game
1202.7 | it's easy from the bleachers to be
1204.74 | yelling at the team be like hi you suck
1207.26 | you could have you could have you could
1208.94 | have passed the ball this way or ah man
1211.46 | just replace them but once you get on
1213.14 | the field you actually recognize and
1215.0 | realize how difficult it actually is to
1218.12 | become a player in the game that's the
1221.48 | first part the second part is you need
1222.98 | to understand what you're signing
1224.059 | yourself up for everybody thinks that
1225.919 | business entrepreneurship Finance crypto
1229.039 | whatever Niche that you're trying to do
1230.66 | that it's just a one way up
1233.12 | everybody signs up for the good times
1234.799 | but nobody signs up for the bad times
1236.419 | and when the bad times come they're like
1238.1 | wait what wait I didn't sign up for this
1239.84 | yeah yeah you signed up for this you
1241.76 | just weren't aware that that's what you
1242.96 | signed up for you signed up for the
1244.16 | training you signed up for every single
1246.14 | day showing up at 5am you signed up for
1248.299 | the ice bass you signed up for the sauna
1250.28 | you signed up for the power lifts you
1251.66 | signed up for every single thing that
1254.059 | you did not realize that was an integral
1257.059 | part to being on the field and what I
1261.44 | often see is especially with Instagram
1263.179 | and you've probably seen it you see the
1264.62 | Lambos you see the cars you see the the
1267.14 | Dubai photos and you see all these
1269.539 | things on the internet and you assume
1271.16 | that that's the cumulative effort or
1273.38 | that's the conclusion and the
1274.82 | wherewithal of business entrepreneurship
1276.5 | and things of this nature but it's not
1278.48 | that is the 0.1 of the outcome that just
1281.9 | happens to be the photo when you're you
1284.059 | know going through Rodeo Drive but
1286.22 | what's on the field is a representation
1288.86 | of what happens in the training camp and
1291.62 | what happens in the training camp is
1293.96 | what develops you as an entrepreneur
1296.48 | so those that want to get into the game
1298.52 | first need to realize what it takes to
1300.559 | get into the game second is they need to
1302.24 | commit to being in the game and being
1304.64 | part of the team and the sacrifice that
1307.1 | it requires to be that player and
1310.039 | finally they need to be willing to show
1312.02 | up you need to show up consistently in
1315.38 | order to win right whether it's a
1317.179 | championship in in football whether it's
1319.64 | a championship in baseball or whatever
1321.5 | sport
1322.64 | you don't just go to one match
1325.039 | win that match and become the champion
1327.2 | it's never worked that way I'll give you
1329.539 | an example messy right I don't know how
1332.179 | much you follow football but messy messy
1334.94 | spent I think 15 to 17 years of his
1337.1 | career playing every single day
1338.9 | basically and then basically at the end
1340.82 | of his career he won the World Cup
1341.96 | that's a cumulative effort of 17 years
1344.419 | if not 30 years of complete dedication
1346.94 | to the craft in order to become the
1349.4 | ultimate winner and that's what it takes
1351.46 | consistency compounds and if you want to
1354.799 | be in the game you need to understand
1356.84 | that you must be willing to sacrifice
1358.82 | who you are today for who you will
1361.039 | become tomorrow and in order to
1363.86 | sacrifice that you need to understand
1365.6 | what you're going to sacrifice you need
1367.46 | to be willing to sacrifice that and I
1370.58 | think that that's how you get into the
1371.72 | game I really believe that it's a
1373.1 | mindset thing before it translates to
1375.86 | relationships before it translates to
1377.539 | getting into the room because if you
1379.159 | develop the right mindset
1381.14 | that mindset will lead you to the right
1383.12 | room but if you just happen to be in the
1386.059 | right room and your mindset isn't
1387.5 | developed well those people that are
1389.059 | already at the next level they won't see
1391.1 | any value for you they they won't see
1392.96 | you as somebody that's special or
1394.22 | somebody that wants it bad enough
1395.539 | they'll just see you as just another
1397.46 | person so if you want to stand out you
1399.5 | must have that winning mindset that
1401.9 | millionaire mindset you've heard it said
1404.0 | real recognize real and when you're an
1407.179 | authentic person and you're interacting
1408.919 | with authentic people that translates in
1412.039 | an extremely visible way
1414.32 | that's the first part the second part is
1416.659 | you mentioned something you know it's
1418.159 | not about what you have it's not about
1420.44 | the skill sets that you that you have
1422.96 | but it's about who you know and I agree
1424.94 | with you because life is about
1427.039 | relationships business is about
1428.659 | relationships even when you're running
1430.4 | an e-commerce business you are in direct
1432.98 | relationship virtually but it's still a
1436.28 | relationship with your customers okay so
1438.26 | you have an iPhone you understand
1439.7 | already that every time that apple rolls
1442.46 | out a new phone the iPhone will be
1444.38 | something that meets your standards or
1445.82 | your expectations or you go into the
1447.98 | store assuming that that's why you're
1449.299 | willing to pay a premium
1451.22 | that's a relationship that's a
1453.08 | relationship based off of trust right so
1455.78 | once you understand that
1458.24 | everything is relationships that
1460.22 | translates also to your ability to
1462.02 | network with the coach or network with
1464.0 | the staff or network with the team I
1466.4 | would take it a step further it's not
1468.08 | about what you know
1470.059 | it's not about who you know and in fact
1472.34 | it's not even about who likes you but
1475.1 | it's about who likes you and who's
1477.919 | willing to go to war for you because so
1480.799 | many people are quick to say oh yeah I
1483.08 | know this person but when they pick up
1484.82 | the phone that person doesn't respond
1486.559 | you know you've seen those people oh
1488.12 | yeah I know Drake I know this guy and oh
1490.58 | I got a photo with this person but do
1492.38 | you actually know that do they know you
1493.82 | and do they like you enough to be
1495.62 | willing to go to war for you and to
1497.72 | develop those things you need to be part
1499.94 | of the team so developing a millionaire
1502.58 | mindset developing winning mindset
1504.4 | understanding that you have to have skin
1506.36 | in the game and being able to
1509.6 | portray that to the people that are
1511.58 | around you I think is what gets you in
1513.62 | the room and sustains you in the room
1515.74 | through irreplaceability you don't want
1518.24 | to be the guy that shows up in the room
1519.44 | one day and then is gone you want to be
1521.0 | the guy that is consistently in the room
1522.679 | providing value is authentic is not a
1525.5 | threat to other people because they are
1527.12 | who they say they are they are of
1529.22 | Integrity they are honest and they have
1531.559 | the skill sets that are necessary to be
1533.84 | part of that winning group we tied that
1535.64 | with a little bow I liked that we took
1537.98 | all the concepts together and put into
1539.72 | one that's nice going a little bit off
1541.82 | book here but I'm curious because you
1543.38 | said you had to make sacrifices right
1545.74 | what have been some of those sacrifices
1548.0 | for you I mean it sounds like you kind
1549.44 | of like to go against the grain is that
1551.419 | something that
1553.34 | is you know your personality or just
1555.32 | going against the grain alienate you
1557.059 | from friends and family and just
1558.98 | basically you know what what are those
1560.419 | sacrifices that you've had to make and
1562.52 | how they affected you I mean it's
1565.4 | uncomfortable to go against the grain as
1567.5 | much as one likes to sit here and be
1569.48 | like oh you know like I'm a person that
1571.94 | goes against the grain it's a lot of
1573.98 | voices that you're up against so you're
1575.48 | going up against a lot of experts or
1577.039 | you're going to lock experts right
1578.24 | you're going up against a lot of uh
1580.159 | experienced people you're going off
1581.659 | against a lot of people that have a
1583.88 | different opinion these situations of
1587.44 | sacrifice
1589.159 | to me are a privilege because we in the
1591.919 | first world country we live in a society
1593.84 | whereby we have the the privilege to
1596.539 | sacrifice things in order to obtain
1598.52 | certain things
1599.9 | but we understand you know you're
1601.76 | talking about manifestation that if we
1604.34 | put one seed in right and we sow one
1608.299 | seed
1609.26 | the reward isn't one seed right you get
1612.74 | an apple tree that yields thousands of
1615.5 | seed and massive fruit so when I
1617.96 | perceive sacrifice I don't perceive it
1620.72 | as a negative thing or as a sorrowful
1623.0 | thing or as a
1624.62 | you know my family doesn't support me or
1626.9 | my friends just don't support me or my
1629.24 | co-workers laugh at me I see it as a
1632.84 | necessary ingredient to live the life
1635.659 | that you want
1636.799 | Leonardo da Vinci famously said to
1640.34 | develop a complete mind study the art of
1642.98 | Science and study the science of art
1645.14 | learn how to see realize that everything
1648.14 | connects to everything else
1650.779 | to understand that suffering sacrifice
1654.1 | connects to everything else that it is
1656.419 | an equation to success you accept it as
1660.2 | a necessary ingredient to get to the top
1662.539 | why because most people are not willing
1664.279 | to do it most people are not willing to
1666.38 | put in the extra mile most people are
1667.94 | not willing to put in the extra
1669.58 | necessary labor they're not willing to
1672.5 | invest in themselves they're not willing
1674.48 | to go through the sacrifice or the
1677.539 | potential loss but when it's all said
1679.94 | and done
1680.96 | you and I are going to end up in the
1682.46 | same place we're going to end up in the
1683.659 | grave so how risky is life it's super
1686.24 | risky we're gonna die right that's the
1687.98 | end game so what is there truly to lose
1689.9 | nothing you just realize that it's part
1692.24 | of the equation and when you understand
1693.98 | that everything connects to everything
1695.779 | else you begin to develop a complete
1698.24 | mind and a complete mind is a mind that
1700.22 | lives in a state of sobriety
1702.02 | the state of sobriety gives you the
1704.0 | opportunity to realize that you cannot
1707.9 | be single focused you cannot just be
1711.08 | focused on winning you cannot just be
1713.24 | focused on making money you need to
1715.1 | develop a complete mind you need to
1717.02 | develop a well-rounded mind you need to
1718.94 | be willing to give up the parties on
1721.1 | Saturday nights well everybody else is
1723.52 | celebrating you know with their little
1725.539 | Shopify bottle board that you see on on
1728.48 | Instagram and things like that
1730.58 | while they're partying you're working
1732.919 | while they're sleeping you're working
1735.919 | while they're at the cinema eating junk
1739.039 | food you're at home healthy eating
1741.799 | organic food developing your mindset why
1744.38 | not because you're a freak but because
1746.179 | you realize that in order to get to the
1748.64 | next level you must be willing to
1750.919 | sacrifice the necessities and the
1753.44 | requirements to get to the next level
1755.36 | it's not by chance a person does not
1759.08 | arrive to the top of the mountain
1760.58 | because he was just simply dropped there
1762.559 | so this idea of luck
1764.36 | to me does not exist to me this idea of
1766.82 | luck is merely probabilities so if you
1769.88 | want to become lucky
1771.26 | you need to increase your probabilities
1773.179 | of success by sacrificing what is
1776.96 | necessary inputting the necessary seeds
1779.6 | and I think you'll reap the reward in
1782.12 | the past you've said that when you can
1783.919 | understand a state of mind you can learn
1786.32 | how to think and most people they didn't
1788.72 | learn how to think so if someone wanted
1791.779 | to change their mindset now like today
1793.94 | and really start thinking for themselves
1795.799 | to be able to attract abundance
1798.98 | where would you recommend they start
1800.659 | like you said the first thing is you
1802.58 | need to realize that you can attract
1804.44 | abundance
1806.08 | you can't chase money you cannot Chase
1810.38 | abundance
1811.88 | you can only attract that which you are
1814.94 | so what you have in life today who you
1818.299 | are in life today is merely a
1821.659 | culmination of who you are as an
1823.82 | individual how you think about the world
1825.799 | and a cumulative effort of your habits
1830.299 | and behaviors so if you want to have a
1832.58 | different life you must be you must
1834.38 | become a different life to learn how to
1836.72 | think
1837.98 | I would give people a simple book
1839.659 | there's a book called The Art of
1841.82 | self-learning before learning how to
1844.58 | think you have to learn how to learn
1845.84 | right just because you were taught in
1847.82 | school how to read a book or that you
1849.559 | had to memorize something doesn't
1850.94 | necessarily mean that that was the way
1853.46 | or the only way of learning for example
1855.98 | people look at mathematics they see
1857.6 | mathematics as a form of problem solving
1861.5 | but what if mathematics is not a form of
1863.84 | problem solving what if it's just a
1865.82 | language and you study these things as a
1868.279 | language and you develop it as a
1869.6 | language skill so maybe you just have to
1871.82 | learn differently once you develop your
1874.58 | ability to learn differently
1876.559 | first question you need to consistently
1878.84 | ask in any realm of life is why
1882.799 | so for example if I'm sitting down and
1885.02 | I've had the privilege of sitting down
1886.159 | with I think about six to eight
1887.539 | billionaires in my life
1889.399 | most of my questions
1891.44 | comprise themselves from the original
1894.38 | question so let's say I ask somebody hey
1897.86 | how did you grow up as a as a kid and
1899.96 | what was your background look like okay
1901.52 | and how did you become successful
1903.38 | I became successful because
1905.659 | let's say I developed a good Network why
1908.899 | was it important for you to develop a
1910.399 | good Network well it was important for
1911.84 | me to develop a good Network because it
1913.34 | allowed me to get into the right room
1914.72 | why was it important for you to get into
1916.7 | the right room and if you ask why you
1919.52 | can get to the root cause or to the most
1922.52 | basic common denominator of the
1924.5 | principle of that thought most people
1926.299 | don't ask why
1927.86 | they don't ask why of anything they just
1930.02 | look at an e-commerce store
1932.659 | and it's converting or it's doing
1934.88 | extremely well like oh man I guess it
1937.52 | would be nice you know to have a to have
1939.799 | a seven figure eight figure store but
1941.539 | they don't ask themselves why do they
1943.22 | have an eight-figure store what is it
1945.26 | that these people are doing
1946.94 | that is different and once you decipher
1949.159 | what they're doing different you need to
1950.72 | ask yourself why is it that what they're
1952.82 | doing differently works
1955.039 | so if you can develop how to think by
1957.38 | the asking the question why so you must
1959.84 | be willing to learn differently so the
1962.659 | art of self-learning is a massive book
1965.419 | that I recommend
1967.159 | develop how to think by asking why and
1970.1 | be a student of Life the moment that you
1972.86 | think that you know is the moment that
1974.48 | you failed so the moment you think you
1976.52 | have the final answer that you have the
1978.14 | final
1979.36 | wherewithal is the moment where you can
1982.1 | get sabotaged
1983.659 | so I'm always going back to my values
1985.58 | I'm always revisiting my ideological
1987.679 | Tendencies I'm always
1990.399 | conscientiously aware of my biases
1994.76 | and understanding that those biases may
1996.98 | not be true and that those biases may
1999.38 | not be the best way to live so a bias
2002.14 | that I used to think when I didn't have
2003.519 | money was oh people that have money are
2005.019 | lucky
2005.919 | but that was that was basically A coping
2008.26 | mechanism for me to live with my
2011.26 | inadequacy as an entrepreneur or as a
2014.2 | failing entrepreneur or as somebody that
2016.24 | used to clean toilets or that used to
2018.22 | pressure wash basketball courts that was
2021.039 | my coping mechanism so as I was there
2022.899 | bitter you know pressure watching the
2025.6 | basketball courts and I saw rich people
2027.159 | successful people I was like oh no they
2028.6 | just got lucky
2029.919 | but did they just get lucky no I just
2032.32 | had it has I just had to ask the
2033.94 | question of why is it that these people
2035.559 | are successful and I'm not and once I
2038.26 | became a student of life I implemented
2040.36 | humility and I understood how to learn
2043.36 | and how to think
2044.679 | I began to develop a complete mind and
2047.98 | in the process of developing complete
2049.72 | mind you develop a complete life
2052.179 | and it's inside Capital Club which what
2054.159 | we talk about it's the creation the
2055.78 | multiplication and the preservation of
2057.28 | wealth and wealth by definition is not
2059.619 | money don't get me mistaken wealth by
2061.72 | definition is abundance so if you're
2065.8 | only rich with money but your family
2067.839 | hates you and you have no friends and
2070.659 | you are lying in a bed dying or you wake
2073.48 | up with stress and with anxiety are you
2076.839 | truly wealthy you and I could probably
2078.639 | both agree that no you're probably not
2080.32 | you're probably not wealthy so to
2082.78 | develop a complete mind you need to
2084.099 | develop a complete life and that means
2086.2 | that you need to become a student of
2087.399 | life in different Avenues so in health
2088.899 | you got to go biohack go do some
2090.58 | grounding you know go uh hang out with
2093.639 | the sun don't be out here under the LED
2095.679 | lights and so many people are like Ecom
2097.359 | entrepreneurs they're like just Lab Rats
2099.339 | all day but even you look at some of the
2102.04 | philosophies and the culture of Shopify
2103.72 | they don't support that lifestyle they
2105.94 | support a balanced lifestyle a a
2107.619 | lifestyle that that has kind of more of
2110.32 | a of a vibey experience to it and I
2113.619 | think that I resonate with you guys with
2115.54 | regards to that so developing a complete
2118.3 | mind will allow you to develop a
2119.8 | complete life and inside the development
2121.839 | of a complete life you will achieve what
2124.48 | I like to call Ultimate success which is
2126.64 | a true balance of living a wealthy
2131.2 | lifestyle health
2133.68 | relationships
2135.52 | finances
2137.74 | are integral
2139.66 | and if you're missing one of them there
2142.24 | will be something missing in your life
2143.619 | and I wish like I truly wish money
2146.44 | wasn't part of the equation but even 2
2149.079 | 000 years ago right the medium of
2150.7 | exchange were cows right so there's
2153.099 | always that Exchange in relationships so
2156.46 | you cannot neglect one
2158.44 | because if you neglect one it'll have
2161.2 | damaging effects to all the other areas
2163.48 | of your life okay so you mentioned about
2165.16 | balance right and I think that's a key
2166.96 | point because you know let's say you
2169.06 | have a ton and ton ton of money or you
2171.04 | have no money do you feel that if there
2173.44 | is you know that one bucket is filled
2176.14 | that you could potentially be missing
2178.78 | out on the other bucket so you know you
2181.359 | mentioned wealth Health family
2183.22 | relationships friends whatever so do you
2186.28 | feel that if there is no not enough
2188.14 | balance because one bucket is overfilled
2190.839 | that maybe the other buckets might be
2192.7 | under filled do you ever see that
2194.56 | pattern in people I think you're always
2197.38 | gonna sacrifice something and it goes
2200.619 | back to the point of sacrifice you know
2202.359 | but it doesn't mean you have to
2203.92 | consistently sacrifice that exact same
2206.26 | thing at all times
2207.88 | and that's what people don't do they're
2209.68 | not willing to change what they want to
2211.18 | sacrifice sometimes you have to
2212.68 | sacrifice your business in order to
2214.66 | sustain your family sometimes you have
2216.16 | to sacrifice your family to sustain your
2218.44 | business sometimes your health may not
2220.78 | be the number one thing on your priority
2222.4 | list but
2224.14 | the health of your business maybe but
2226.0 | sometimes the business will be affected
2228.4 | in the health of the business will be
2229.599 | affected in order for you to sustain
2231.04 | your personal uh health so I think being
2234.16 | a person that understands that
2237.06 | balance
2238.66 | as paradoxical as it sounds is in the
2243.28 | balance of the unbalanced lifestyle and
2247.24 | it's understanding how to Pivot in that
2249.64 | unbalance that allows you to balance
2251.92 | yourself extremely well why
2254.5 | because we live in a world that is
2256.96 | constantly changing and unless you can
2258.88 | flow right like Bruce Lee says Be Like
2261.04 | Water my friend you have to flow right
2262.96 | so unless you're willing to flow with
2264.52 | the rhythms of life then you're always
2266.619 | going to be an anchor and if you're an
2268.42 | anchor you end up being in a situation
2271.359 | where you're stagnant and stagnant is
2273.4 | where you die stagnant is like the swamp
2276.28 | but to be flowy you need to be able to
2278.68 | move and to be able to move you must be
2280.48 | willing to adapt and to be able to adapt
2283.0 | you must be willing to understand that
2284.38 | there's different things that you must
2285.64 | sacrifice it sacrifice at different
2287.32 | points in order to achieve your goal it
2290.8 | all comes down to your goal right like
2292.599 | what is your goal and people have this
2295.359 | idea of okay my goal is to become a
2297.16 | multi-millionaire well is it truly your
2299.38 | goal
2300.4 | or is that what you've been told is the
2302.74 | goal that leads to something else what
2305.2 | is that other thing yes money is
2307.119 | important money is great but do you need
2309.28 | a billion dollars oh yeah I need a
2310.78 | billion dollars or is that your ego
2312.16 | saying that you need a billion dollars
2313.54 | because you want that billionaire status
2315.4 | oh well I want to have a publicly traded
2317.619 | company well do you understand and what
2319.18 | it implies to have a publicly traded
2321.16 | company are you just saying you want to
2322.3 | publicly trade a company because that's
2323.98 | what you think success is so you need to
2326.26 | really understand and Define what it is
2328.0 | that you want in life and I like to call
2331.24 | it the Symphony of success
2333.4 | that's what I like to call it the
2335.5 | Symphony of success what does success
2337.839 | sound like to you not to somebody else
2340.78 | not to your parents not to your
2342.46 | co-workers not to your your business
2345.099 | partners not to society not to culture
2347.859 | culture
2349.32 | but to you what does the Symphony of
2353.02 | success sound like to you and once you
2354.52 | can fine tune and find that sweet melody
2356.38 | that resonates just to you to your soul
2358.72 | to your spirit as an individual
2361.119 | you need to pursue that with what focus
2364.38 | with all the distractions that are
2366.7 | coming through so you need to understand
2368.14 | that you need to live an imbalanced life
2370.54 | with a balanced perspective
2372.339 | understanding that you must sacrifice
2374.02 | different things at different times
2375.76 | you must be focused
2378.16 | to
2379.48 | be attuned to the symphony of success
2381.88 | that is particular to you and
2386.68 | only you can hear it
2389.14 | and to be okay with being misunderstood
2392.8 | to being judged to being condemned and
2396.28 | misrepresented in society because you do
2398.92 | not fit the molds of culture let's talk
2402.22 | about negative self-talk for a second so
2404.8 | when we engage in negative self-talk we
2407.2 | form neural Pathways that get
2408.88 | strengthened over time so that the more
2411.28 | negative thoughts we have the more
2413.02 | negative thoughts we're going to create
2414.46 | for ourselves in the future
2416.56 | and negative thoughts turn into a
2418.3 | negative reality which is obviously the
2420.16 | polar opposite to abundance so my
2422.74 | question to you is have you ever
2424.66 | struggled with negative self-talk and
2426.94 | how do you avoid it today your
2429.099 | perception is your reality
2431.74 | how you perceive reality may not be how
2435.4 | reality is how you perceive reality is
2438.94 | how you experience reality you talk
2442.24 | about emotions and emotions are the
2445.18 | foundation on by which you experience
2447.4 | everything so of how you experience
2449.7 | reality is through emotions if you can
2453.099 | understand how to and be in a state of
2455.56 | equanimity which if you look at the
2457.599 | definition of equanimity it's calmness
2459.76 | of the soul to be transformed you are
2462.46 | transformed through the renewal of your
2464.079 | mind your job is instead of focusing on
2466.78 | being transformed is to focus on the
2469.66 | renewal of your mind and that means the
2472.42 | foods that you eat have an implication
2474.64 | with your head the music that you listen
2476.859 | to the people that you surround yourself
2478.96 | with the self-talk that you have may not
2482.56 | be self-talk it may just be a
2485.26 | repercussion of all the other habits
2487.9 | that you have in your life I'll give you
2490.0 | an example
2491.26 | the gut is known as the second brain
2493.72 | right it's known as a second brain you
2495.88 | can study the microbiome of the of the
2498.64 | human body
2499.9 | when this saying came out of trust your
2502.96 | gut well where did it come from like who
2505.78 | came up with that thought did it just is
2507.64 | it just a saying or is it actually true
2511.119 | so in order for you to develop a healthy
2513.64 | gut you need to eat healthy foods so if
2516.64 | you're out here eating Pringles every
2518.02 | single day if you're out here drinking
2519.579 | Coca-Cola every single day you will not
2521.38 | have a healthy gut
2523.24 | gut produces a chemical known as the
2526.54 | happy chemical which is what serotonin
2528.839 | serotonin is in charge of regulating the
2532.42 | biochemistry of your body so if you have
2534.88 | a healthy gut you will become
2536.92 | automatically happier because the
2540.4 | production of Serotonin will be Stellar
2543.52 | by Renewing Your Mind you become a
2548.2 | different person
2549.4 | those are my thoughts love them uh we
2551.98 | talked about risk taking before now I
2554.56 | myself am not a risk taker I'm actually
2556.06 | risk averse so when I hear that you've
2558.099 | bet tons of money with crypto literally
2560.26 | gives me a heart attack and an even
2562.3 | bigger heart attack knowing that you've
2564.46 | lost Millions with crypto as well so
2566.2 | what I want to know is in those moments
2568.78 | how are you able to recompose yourself
2571.06 | and say okay we're gonna try this again
2574.119 | and then recalibrate your mindset so
2575.98 | that after failure you you come in
2579.099 | stronger the second time what what's
2581.079 | going on in your head when you are
2583.0 | recalibrating so there is a give and
2585.099 | take in all things and I think that as
2587.2 | you continue to develop yourself and as
2589.9 | I continue to develop myself and develop
2591.64 | that confidence
2593.319 | it's understanding that it's a game of
2595.9 | probabilities right so it's a risk and
2598.42 | reward ratio
2599.859 | and it all comes down to knowledge and
2601.599 | information so for example if you talk
2603.28 | about investing in crypto investing in
2604.839 | the markets or starting a business the
2607.119 | markets can go two ways either up or
2608.859 | down you have a 50 50 chance
2610.72 | businesses have an 80 chance of failure
2612.819 | so when I look at that metric in and of
2614.56 | itself I'm like okay well I'm it's it's
2616.42 | red or black right and at the end of the
2618.7 | day I prefer the casino of the markets
2620.859 | as opposed to the casino
2622.98 | in uh Las Vegas simply because I can
2626.5 | actually walk away from the table with
2627.819 | some money that's the first part the
2629.319 | second part is understanding these
2631.359 | Market Cycles
2632.68 | in a very simple way I'll tell you
2634.66 | something that I did right it was the
2636.16 | month of October this past October
2639.0 | 2022 and I put out a tweet I said I'm
2642.04 | putting 10 of my net worth into
2643.72 | metastock and I'm buying Shopify stock
2646.359 | when it was about 25 this is the peak
2649.72 | bottom what was my entire thesis my
2652.96 | entire thesis was a very simple one for
2654.819 | better for worse
2656.92 | it was accurate
2658.72 | it was
2660.099 | whether it's q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 I'll let you
2663.819 | answer the question out of all the four
2665.859 | quarters based off of holidays and
2667.599 | things of this nature when people are
2669.04 | spending Tendencies when do people spend
2671.74 | the most amount of money two three four
2674.5 | maybe three or two four correct so
2676.48 | correct so you look you're looking at uh
2678.94 | Christmas you're looking at Thanksgiving
2680.5 | you're looking at all the holidays
2682.599 | what this means is that the advertisers
2684.7 | the e-commerce stores they know that
2688.18 | they are going to have to ramp up their
2689.92 | ad spend and shopify's revenue is going
2692.859 | to increase in Q4 that when the time
2695.859 | comes in q1 for them to report their
2698.56 | earnings their earnings
2700.78 | without fail almost every single year
2703.24 | they beat expectations why so you do as
2706.42 | a student of History you understand
2708.099 | history you understand the patterns
2709.66 | pattern recognition and based off of
2712.06 | pattern recognition you dictate your
2713.74 | risk and reward ratio to make your
2715.359 | calculated bet on how the future is
2717.46 | going to lay out so I was layer buying
2720.819 | that means buying stocks at different
2723.339 | prices to have a dollar cost average
2726.04 | entry of meta between 82 and 62 or
2731.74 | something along those lines but my my
2733.9 | entry level was extremely cheap now Med
2736.42 | is at about 270 dollars right so without
2739.54 | really doing a whole lot of math I
2741.88 | understood that most people are going to
2744.339 | spend advertising dollars on Q4 Shopify
2746.98 | is going to have a massive Q4 because
2748.9 | they take a cut off of every transaction
2751.06 | if you're using Shopify payments or
2752.859 | people are opening up new stores
2755.68 | they're going to have phenomenal
2757.119 | revenues and if you look at their
2759.099 | earnings reports in q1 about Q4 that
2762.819 | prediction was accurate and that
2764.319 | prediction simply came from my
2766.0 | understanding of every single Q4 that
2768.22 | meta had because I looked into it you
2770.56 | can look it up Yahoo finance you can
2772.24 | look up some articles in every single Q4
2774.579 | that Shopify had so I'm in a situation
2777.46 | where I'm like hmm okay Med is already
2780.22 | down 80 as a stock
2782.44 | yeah maybe it has a potential to go down
2784.42 | another five percent I could lose some
2785.98 | money but what is the risk reward the
2788.44 | risk is I lose a little bit of money the
2790.359 | reward is a massive payday and now that
2793.24 | stock is up 150 percent
2795.22 | so some people will be like oh well
2796.42 | that's not the reason a stock goes up
2797.859 | who knows right but it did go up and
2800.74 | that premise stood true over the last
2802.359 | couple years
2803.92 | so I think risk adverse
2807.7 | is good but I think calculated risk is
2812.619 | even better you do not want to be
2814.24 | sitting you know watching Everybody win
2817.02 | at some point it's like you know what
2819.339 | maybe they know something that I don't
2821.74 | and if you can decipher what is that
2823.42 | people know that you don't
2825.819 | understand those things understand the
2827.98 | risk reward scenario of a situation then
2830.74 | you can begin to position yourself
2832.66 | extremely well whether it is that you're
2835.06 | an employee whether it is that you're an
2836.5 | executive in a company whether it is
2838.42 | that you're an entrepreneur the
2840.22 | objective is everybody wants to make
2841.96 | more money so now the question is how
2843.94 | can I be a glitch in the system find
2845.74 | glitches in the system and identify
2848.68 | these glitches and capitalize on them
2851.2 | and you don't have to be extremely
2853.0 | intelligent in order to find them you
2854.68 | just have to ask why why why why why
2858.579 | take the time to study educate yourself
2860.88 | and relearn how you were taught how the
2864.46 | world works and I think that
2867.52 | you'll be in a good situation on that
2869.319 | note put us on do you have any books
2871.72 | podcasts any public figures that our
2874.42 | viewers should know about if they want
2875.74 | to learn more about mastering their
2877.48 | mindset to achieve success there's this
2879.94 | guy known as Luke Belmar not just
2882.0 | there's there's a really good book
2884.02 | called The Millionaire uh master plan
2886.119 | it's a book that I think resonates a lot
2889.06 | with me and the millionaire master plan
2891.339 | is a premise that gives you an
2892.96 | understanding as where you are in in
2895.839 | business and where you are in your
2898.3 | career so this is more for the the
2899.859 | entrepreneurs if you're listening
2901.06 | millionaire master plan and one of the
2903.16 | phrases that really caught my attention
2904.599 | you might resonate with this is the
2907.24 | author tells us that there's two ways of
2909.88 | making money
2911.319 | consider that
2913.839 | dollar signs represent butterflies
2916.079 | butterflies are flying around your goals
2918.4 | to catch as many butterflies as you can
2920.02 | each butterfly represents let's say a
2921.94 | hundred dollars
2923.26 | now there's two types of entrepreneurs
2924.88 | the first type of entrepreneur will
2926.68 | develop a net right it doesn't matter
2929.56 | how intricate that net is how advanced
2932.44 | it may be in order for this entrepreneur
2935.14 | to catch butterflies they have to
2937.66 | consistently swing their net what this
2940.359 | means is that
2942.16 | one side of the equation
2944.26 | always has to commit to tedious labor
2947.26 | and consistent labor in order for them
2949.0 | to make money they have to give up their
2951.22 | time for their money which is fine most
2952.78 | people have to do that
2954.52 | but then you have the other side of the
2955.96 | equation which is the entrepreneur that
2958.42 | creates a garden that attracts
2960.339 | butterflies so they create the flowers
2962.079 | they put up the river stream they put up
2965.26 | the the vegetable garden and they
2968.319 | attract butterflies into the garden and
2970.54 | create an ecosystem
2972.4 | once you have enough butterflies through
2975.22 | net right you need to be able to change
2977.5 | the way that you operate which I always
2979.0 | call going from Hustler to boss
2981.099 | talking about mindset
2983.02 | to then creating a garden and remember
2986.5 | the garden takes time you have to plow
2989.319 | the soil you have to be tedious it's
2992.319 | going to rain you have to take care of
2993.819 | the plants but if you can create an
2995.8 | ecosystem right that develops
3000.359 | butterflies and attracts butterflies
3002.579 | into the ecosystem it's going to be a
3004.68 | lot more fruitful I'll give you a very
3005.88 | basic example the guys that founded
3007.98 | Shopify they could have easily created
3009.839 | the Shopify platform as their own
3012.74 | e-commerce platform for their own stores
3015.119 | right they could have easily done that
3017.22 | they would have been able to build a
3018.599 | couple stores do extremely well make 7A
3020.819 | figures
3021.96 | but they created an ecosystem for
3024.359 | everybody to be able to create stores
3025.98 | for everybody to be able to develop
3027.9 | inside of that ecosystem they created an
3030.3 | App Store they created events they
3032.16 | created this phenomenal podcast with a
3034.079 | great Host this is part of a garden that
3037.02 | is attracting butterflies so you must be
3040.26 | able to shift that mindset so that's the
3042.9 | millionaire mindset for people that want
3044.819 | to get to the next level in their
3046.5 | mindset in their way that they perceive
3048.059 | money
3050.099 | on the money side understanding what
3052.26 | money is there's a book called Lords of
3054.24 | easy money it's a little bit of a
3056.52 | difficult read so I recommend people
3058.74 | just
3059.839 | uh read the audiobook but it tells you
3063.42 | basically how money is created how it
3065.64 | goes from the primary lenders and
3067.74 | basically makes its way into the market
3069.96 | when you hear trillions of dollars were
3072.0 | printed right or the FED prints three
3073.98 | million dollars what does that mean what
3075.599 | what does that mean and what are the
3076.8 | implications for me on that side so
3078.839 | that's on the financial mindset
3081.359 | and on the spiritual mindset
3084.54 | none
3086.16 | you need to be presently aware
3088.8 | you need to
3091.74 | understand
3093.72 | that most people they're not living here
3097.02 | right now so for example I'll give you
3098.4 | an example Right Here Right Now the most
3100.079 | the single most important thing in my
3102.119 | life right now isn't whether this video
3104.16 | is getting published on YouTube or that
3106.26 | I'm doing a podcast the single most
3107.88 | important thing in my life right now is
3109.68 | that I'm speaking with you why because
3111.9 | that's where I'm investing my time
3113.22 | that's where you're investing your time
3115.02 | so in this symbiosis of this
3117.839 | relationship when I'm speaking to you
3119.52 | you right now are the most important
3121.68 | thing to me because I'm giving you the
3123.359 | most precious asset that I have right
3125.22 | being in the present moment to you and
3126.839 | you're doing so to me and whether people
3129.9 | get the value of listening to this or
3131.7 | not is irrelevant I'm conversing with
3133.319 | you right and when you are presently
3136.26 | aware and you're not living in the past
3138.359 | and you're not living in the future
3139.559 | which is usually where most people live
3141.18 | right most people are driving or they're
3142.98 | at work and they're like oh well what do
3144.119 | I need to do when I get home or they're
3146.04 | at home and they're like what do I need
3147.24 | to do tomorrow morning
3148.619 | or you know they make a bad trade in
3151.319 | crypto they live in the past or they
3153.42 | make a good trade in crypto they live in
3155.099 | the past
3156.54 | oftentimes when you live in the past you
3158.7 | live in a depressed state why because
3160.319 | you cannot change that which you've
3161.76 | already done
3163.079 | if you live in the future you live in a
3165.24 | state of anxiety because you cannot
3167.22 | control the future and most people
3169.02 | conjure up a status of the future that
3172.38 | tends to have negative Tendencies
3174.0 | attached to it simply because we have a
3175.8 | fight or flight response right so we
3177.839 | have a fight-or-flight response that
3179.64 | gives us the tendency of protection so
3182.7 | we kind of live a life of anxiety
3184.819 | thinking about the predators of the
3187.2 | future
3188.4 | we think about what we lost in the past
3190.26 | therefore we're depressed but when
3191.52 | you're presently aware you're here right
3193.14 | now I'm here with you you're here with
3194.46 | me that develops equanimity
3197.52 | calmness there's nothing Beyond this
3200.339 | conversation because that's what we're
3201.48 | doing right now so for the mindset part
3204.3 | of self notebook just that data set just
3208.319 | that concept what really resonated with
3210.059 | me was when you were talking about the
3212.099 | butterflies and you know those
3214.92 | butterflies can represent and they can
3217.2 | represent money they can represent
3218.52 | health happiness but I totally
3220.98 | understand where you're coming from when
3222.3 | you say you know build your garden
3224.4 | you know yeah get your flowers get your
3227.22 | soil because I have noticed in my own
3229.079 | life when I am busy building my garden
3231.48 | and I'm busy eating well surrounding
3233.88 | myself with good people working hard
3236.099 | whatever finding that balance in my life
3238.079 | I find that abundance comes to me versus
3241.02 | when I catch myself and I'm like with my
3243.66 | net I'm like but I need all that when
3246.059 | you're like I'm in a I need need you're
3248.76 | saying to the universe I don't have so
3250.92 | then you don't get so
3252.9 | I understand what you're saying for sure
3254.9 | so on that note what is one
3259.2 | life-changing piece of advice that
3260.76 | you've received and how did it change
3262.92 | your life A wise man once told me
3265.2 | investing in people
3268.079 | is like a gold mine
3269.819 | sometimes you have to use Dynamite but
3272.64 | sometimes you have to use the small
3274.14 | chisel as you build your teams as you
3276.9 | build your businesses as you
3279.72 | build your relationships understand that
3282.66 | the people that you interact with they
3284.4 | are like gold mines
3286.2 | they have a lot of value to provide they
3288.359 | have a lot of
3289.619 | wisdom to provide they have a lot of
3291.9 | good traits and opportunities and
3294.18 | possibilities to present to you
3295.559 | sometimes you have to Boom Dynamite hey
3298.2 | you need to get this done sometimes you
3299.76 | need to work you need to hustle but
3301.44 | sometimes in relationships you need to
3304.2 | use the small chisel a lot of people
3306.9 | want instant gratification whether it's
3309.24 | you know we're talking about you're
3310.619 | saying hey I'm most happy when I'm
3312.24 | building my garden not when I'm out here
3313.8 | swinging that idea of swinging is often
3315.96 | attached to instant gratification and
3317.88 | instant desire it's the same thing with
3319.68 | relationships because it all comes back
3321.24 | down to relationships and it all boils
3323.16 | down to the fact that you're dealing
3324.78 | with human beings people with emotions
3326.52 | people with problems people with more
3329.4 | complex lives than yourself but often we
3332.22 | live life as a main character of the
3334.74 | video game
3335.819 | when we don't stop to realize that every
3338.04 | other person is living life as the main
3340.14 | character of their own video game and
3342.0 | once you understand that you treat
3343.5 | relationships and you treat people
3346.079 | not for who they are but for who they're
3348.359 | capable of being which is gold mines and
3351.9 | that means that through truth sometimes
3353.579 | you have to be explosive in the
3354.72 | relationship but then sometimes you have
3356.52 | to be gentle and caring that's one of
3358.38 | the most uh valuable principles that
3360.24 | I've learned when it comes to
3362.22 | or pieces of advice that it comes to
3364.02 | relationships but on the personal side
3365.819 | can I give you one more can I give you
3367.5 | one more data set data sets is what I
3369.24 | like to call them be an authentic person
3371.42 | being authentic I was talking to a guy
3373.98 | by the name of Gary brecka he owns 10x
3377.04 | Health Systems with Grant Cardone
3379.14 | and we're talking about vibrational
3380.52 | frequencies and he said you know Luke
3382.5 | I've been studying vibrational
3383.46 | frequencies for about 12 years now
3386.099 | and you know people often talk about
3388.02 | this idea of
3390.96 | you know if you look at the Spectrum of
3392.339 | vibrational frequencies you can look it
3394.02 | up on Google has a chart
3396.48 | on the highest side you have gratitude
3398.28 | and love
3399.3 | and above that you have this idea of
3401.94 | Enlightenment but what does
3403.38 | Enlightenment even mean
3405.42 | said Luke you know what I was putting
3407.16 | people in a fair day cage Fair Day cage
3409.02 | is a is kind of this contraption that
3411.48 | either hackers use or or people use
3413.7 | where no 5G no Wi-fi signals no
3416.76 | sort of
3418.26 | electrical signals can come in or
3420.24 | impulses can come into that box and they
3423.42 | Place subjects in there and those
3425.339 | subjects were conditioned to different
3426.96 | tests and he said you know what I found
3429.18 | Luke to be that highest form of
3431.22 | vibration 400 times at a higher
3434.76 | vibration than the frequency of love
3437.099 | he said Luke it was the frequency of
3439.92 | authenticity the highest form of living
3443.04 | life
3444.3 | is living life authentically being the
3448.2 | truest version of yourself
3451.26 | and once I realized this principle that
3454.38 | I don't have to impress anybody I don't
3456.24 | have to impress you you don't have to
3457.74 | impress me I don't have to impress the
3459.839 | culture I don't have to be subjugated to
3463.44 | the ideologies of my parents or of my
3465.78 | religion or or of what television is
3469.2 | telling me I can be who I was created to
3472.319 | be
3473.22 | I can be my authentic self now you begin
3475.8 | to live life
3477.54 | with
3479.28 | no pressure
3481.02 | which is a great way of living so when I
3483.3 | heard this idea of living life in an
3486.359 | authentic way because it's the highest
3487.74 | form of vibration and if you're seeking
3489.359 | a life that is in balancing in tune
3493.14 | you can do that through
3496.14 | being your authentic self now the
3498.359 | question is who are you and that is the
3501.119 | ultimate journey of life through
3502.74 | business through entrepreneurship
3504.0 | through everything is who are you who
3505.68 | are you created to be and the beauties
3507.72 | that you allow you can Define that
3509.099 | yourself
3510.18 | and
3512.46 | that's the greatest principle I've
3513.839 | learned amazing yeah that was good you
3516.0 | answered my next question I was going to
3517.26 | say you know how do you decide what has
3520.74 | been learned and what is actually you
3523.079 | and
3524.64 | we're going through it we're figuring it
3526.2 | out as we go but let's close with a warm
3528.66 | and fuzzy one so who do you wish to
3531.599 | become and what do you wish for this
3533.94 | world I wish to be the best version of I
3537.24 | will be
3538.559 | the greatest version of myself
3540.54 | the best version of myself a person that
3544.26 | doesn't wish
3546.059 | but
3547.619 | through the art of understanding what
3549.66 | manifestation is which is like Isaac
3552.0 | Newton said energy cannot be created or
3554.339 | destroyed it can only be Transformer
3556.92 | transmuted through your input
3559.2 | for
3561.24 | every action there's an equal and
3562.859 | opposite reaction one of the laws of the
3564.839 | universe
3565.68 | you can live a life that you can control
3568.2 | your output you can control who you are
3570.0 | by controlling what you do
3572.46 | so most people say I want I wish to
3575.16 | become somebody or I wish to be this
3576.96 | person or I wish to be this type of
3578.339 | individual
3579.66 | without understanding that you have to
3581.4 | be willing to train in order to play the
3583.559 | game in order to become the champion
3586.44 | I don't wish to become anybody I
3589.859 | know by universal law
3592.68 | that that which I
3595.559 | so I will reap
3597.78 | and
3599.16 | and my
3601.799 | goal in life
3604.02 | is to live by my definition of success
3607.859 | and I define success very simply in this
3610.68 | way the persistent and consistent
3613.74 | Pursuit
3615.24 | of your fullest potential
3617.76 | not what I say is your potential not
3621.42 | what I deem for you is success
3624.839 | once again the Symphony of success to
3626.52 | you and what is your potential not
3628.38 | limiting yourself to 30 percent through
3630.359 | being risk adverse or you know through
3632.88 | listening to somebody else but
3635.579 | the consistent and persistent pursuit of
3639.42 | your fullest potential if you wake up
3641.04 | every single day and you say I'm going
3642.359 | to pursue being the greatest person that
3644.099 | I can be because I only have guaranteed
3645.839 | right now
3647.04 | you can live life with such color and
3650.359 | livelihood that when it's all said and
3652.98 | done
3654.54 | when I'm lying on my deathbed at that
3657.66 | point we'll have another Zoom call and
3660.599 | we'll define whether or not I was
3662.22 | successful but until then just uh
3664.76 | pursuing that that authentic self
3666.96 | pursuing that potential that I was given
3670.559 | and not settling for Less what do you
3673.26 | wish for the world
3674.76 | that they find truth that they do not
3677.099 | settle for what somebody else has told
3679.68 | them the world is
3681.66 | do they do not settle for what somebody
3684.0 | else has told them reality is
3686.28 | or who they are
3687.78 | or what they were created to be
3690.299 | but that they may understand that those
3692.88 | that know the truth
3694.68 | shall be set free by the truth
3697.14 | and I do believe that truth is
3700.46 | established I do not think that truth is
3703.099 | kind of malleable because then it
3705.299 | wouldn't be truth so the question is
3707.04 | what is true and how do I find what is
3710.28 | true in a world that is full of lies and
3712.619 | how do I find authenticity in a world
3715.02 | that's full of inauthenticity
3717.24 | and how do I become the best version of
3719.46 | myself if people could do that through
3722.28 | the chaos through the tribulation
3723.66 | through the trauma
3725.88 | through the challenges of life there's
3728.76 | still hope and I and I know that's
3730.5 | difficult to say
3731.94 | for a lot of people and I know it may be
3733.68 | difficult to understand you know you
3735.359 | have people that are have failing
3736.68 | businesses people that were affected by
3738.24 | covet and you know their businesses went
3740.28 | down or people that don't have money or
3741.72 | they don't see a way out my hope for my
3744.78 | wish for
3746.099 | for Humanity is to live life
3749.119 | authentically and to pursue truth and in
3751.68 | that truth you will find Hope because
3753.599 | you shall know the truth and the truth
3755.099 | shall set you free from all your
3756.48 | tribulations all your troubles and all
